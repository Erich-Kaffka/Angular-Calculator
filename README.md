# ECalculator v1.0.1

Simple calculator application in Angular. Trying to replicate most of the functionality in a standard calculator - still a work in progress.

ToDo: Doesn't quite follow BEDMAS operations (Could be issue with calculator screen and what is actually being calculated)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If this doesn't work, ensure you have the latest version of npm using `npm update` and try `ng serve` once more.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
